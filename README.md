Particle Labeling MLP:

The program is a classification agent that uses a combination of a multilayer perceptron (PyTorch implementation) and a support vector machine to accurately predict the labels for data points on a 2-dimensional plane. Some of the required specifications for the model included training the MLP on some training data with a small period of time (5 minutes max) and applying the prediction to a new data set. The ratio of correct vs incorrect labels was the measure of how well the agent did. This particular agent topped out a peak predict accuracy of 95.8%. While not runnable (code to run the program exists in the unknowing void of gradescope), the code itself serves as the demonstration.
